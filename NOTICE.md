## wger exercise data

`lib/ui2/activity/wger_exercises.g.dart` contains selected fields (names,
aliases, muscles, equipment, categories) from the [wger](https://wger.de)
exercise database, limited to the movements listed in
`tool/wger_weightlifting_selection.dart`. Each entry is available under
CC BY-SA 3.0, CC BY-SA 4.0 or CC0, and each row keeps its source UUID and the
author/license credits of its base data and translations. This data stays under
those licenses, separate from the AGPL-licensed code. Refresh with
`dart run tool/update_wger_exercises.dart`.
